# Description
The provided code and SQL involved the creation of a banking database by collecting data from various sources, including the FDIC website and bank websites, along with fabricated entries. Tables were established, and relationships were defined using foreign keys. Triggers and stored procedures were implemented to enhance database functionality. Challenges during data insertion were addressed by ensuring consistency in related attribute values. Lessons learned emphasized the importance of data integrity and backup strategies. Additionally, an advanced Python application was developed using pymysql to connect to the SQL database and utilize procedures, functions, events, and triggers. This project provided practical experience in database management, SQL usage, and application development within the banking domain.
